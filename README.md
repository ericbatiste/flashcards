## Abstract
In this project we were tasked with writting a robust test suite to accompany the implementation code to create a flashcard game / quiz that runs in the terminal rather than on a webpage.  We wrote both the test code as well as the implementation code to be tested.

## Demo

## Tech Used
This quiz / game leverages Javascript and node.js to run in the terminal on your local device. 

## Install/Setup
Clone down your own forked copy of the repo.  'Cd' into the root directory in your terminal, from there run 'node index.js' to play the game / quiz on your local machine.
